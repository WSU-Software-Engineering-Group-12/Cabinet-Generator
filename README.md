# Cabinet-Generator
An app that we are making for our Software Engineering class at Wayne State University.
This will be a browser-based web app made with a React frontend and a Django backend

**Intended Functionality**
- Users will input 3 walls of a room that they want cabinets in
- Users will also input any obstructions in that room (windows, sinks, outlets, etc)
- App will then generate a cabinet layout based on the room dimensions
- App will allow users to export a PDF of the cabinet layout that carpenters could use

**Stretch Goals**
- Find a way to make money off this app
- Allow users to edit the cabinet layout
